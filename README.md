# Explanation
(Java)HW1
-part1
Cargo Company automation with a custom container

-part2
Cargo company program with java arrays

(pdf)HW2=> 
-Analysis of some algorithms

(Java)HW3
1-Implementing a custom linked list which also keep an array in nodes
2-Implementing a text editor it reads data add a specific position, finds a word and replace a word also gives a log file to measure time for different size of texts

(Java)HW4=>
(pdf)1-Converting some infix expressions to postfix and prefix
2-Implementing a custom Deque structure which keeps also removed nodes so we can use removed nodes again when we want to add another node
3-A recursive function which takes a matrix  and print them by round it

(Java)HW5=>
1-Creating a filesystem tree also include search add remove operations 
2-Creating an expression tree can evaluate postfix and prefix expressions 
3-4- Creating maxheap and search tree according to their ages and number of people

(java)HW7
1- Visualization of insertion deletion operations of AVLTree Red-BlackTree 2-3Tree Skiplist B-Tree with order 4 (pdf)
3-Softwarestore automation by using search tree


=>The projects above are working based on terminal and there is some handwritten pdfs. They have reports and java documentations within
